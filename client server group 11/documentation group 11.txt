__________We designed this system refering to popular ticketing systems in Rwanda like RITCO,HORIZONS,....

This system used by two different users including admin and agent(normal users) day to day workers  
and every user will have their own controls according to its type. 

____________________________________________________________________START  OF ADMIN ACCESS

Admin will allowed to use system  throuth the login form and his cridatios is hard coded 
(username: admin and password:admin ) 
and do different activities including the following

•Admin can view different statistics in numbers as shown in bellow screenshoot
 after login  where there is number of buses in company, number of users,number of directions in company,…(home menu)


•Admin can add buses
As menus showed admin have access to add and modify campany buses which used to assing to any jurney(route)
 before agent/user cut ticket to clients()customers.

•Admin can add and modify company directions and give amount of many to that directions

•Admin can add/modify jurney(route) to make it clear route is setted over the time but direction is fixed ,
 means while we create route(journey) admin need to assign direction,time,buss to that route in order to make 
agent easy for cut ticket to client

•Admin can also add and modify agents/user and give username and password
•Admin can also view report for amount and ticket buyed day to day (by seraching dates(day))
User (agent) 

____________________________________________________________________END OF ADMIN ACCESS


User/ agent is one who has responsible to cut ticket to any customers as we know for
 any travering agency(Horizon,ritco,…)

____________________________________________________________________START OF AGENT/USER ACCESS
He can do the following in our system
•Firstly he/she have to login with cridentos given by admin 
•After login he has to search route available jurnel added by admin add record customer ticket 
by adding  that route id coresponding to  customer (route) he/she wishe after record it the system 
will display ticket information and print it !


____________________________________________________________________END  OF AGENT/USER ACCESS



REMINDER
1.admin has hardcoded cridatios to login (username:admin, password:admin) 
 while admin has to record agent/users and give them cridentos used to login

2 our server name to connect to exported database is (cit\sqlexpress)
database name is exported and its name is ticket

our connection string 
"Data Source=cit\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=ticket;Integrated Security=True"
